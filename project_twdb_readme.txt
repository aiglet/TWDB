Hi!  Welcome to the Web Triggers Database project.

The intent of the project is to allow people to add "trigger warnings" to commercially available fiction, so no one runs into nasty surprises.

Here's my intended schedule:

V1: MVP
- allow lookup of books by ISBN via Google Books API
  ref: https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using
- display minimal book data
	- title
	- author
	- cover image thumbnail
- allow users to tag books based on pre-generated tags
- display book data with tags

V2: Better
NOTE: from here on "users" means "users with accounts" and "anons" means "users without accounts"
- allow users to create accounts
- allow users to generate their own tags
- allow users to select whether to show only "site" tags or also user-generated ones
  note: the intention is to display any tag that gets generated by more than five users, and eventually to update the "site" tags to include them
- display more book data
  - summary
  - publish date
  - other stuff?
    - genre (this may need to be done via user tagging?)
    - page count
- show tags with "heat mapping"
  e.g., tags display differently based on how often they've been selected for any given book
- allow users to select between viewing all tags and user-only tags
  i.e., don't show tags by anons
  
V3: Mobile native app
All features of V1 website plus:
- barcode reader/interpreter for lookup

V4+: Bridges to burn when we get to them
- forums
- extended data
  - reviews
  - notes
- fancy searching
  - allow users to specify "most disliked tags" and then search based on "books that don't have that tag"
- positive tags 
  note: the viability of this will be influenced by what turns up in the user generated tags
